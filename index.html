                <p>The Uchiha Clan is a part of the Hidden Leaf Village. They used to be a part of the police force. They planned to start a coup d'etat against the Hidden Leaf Village, <br>
                but the plan was foiled due to Itachi Uchiha who chose to protect the village. The Uchiha Clan use the kekkai genkai(Bloodline Ability) dojutsu Sharingan(Meaning: Copy Wheel Eye), but it <br>
                only appears selectively among the members of the clan. The Sharingan is regarded as one of the "Great Three Dojutsu", the others being the Byakugan and Rinnegan. While <br>
                its powers originated from Kaguya Otsutsuki's Rinne Sharingan, its independant form was first manifested by Indra Otsutsuki(Hagoromo Otsutsuki in the anime). The Sharingan <br>
                evolves when it's reached the third Tomoe(the dot-like shapes around the pupil) and the user experiences great loss, especially of someone close to them. </p>

                <p>The Hyuga Clan is a part of the Hidden Leaf Village. It is one of the four noble clans, as well as the strongest clan in the village. All members born to into this clan possess the <br>
                    Byakugan, a kekkei genkai that gives them extended fields of vision and the abiltity to see through solid objects and even the chakra circulatory system, amongst other things. Members <br>
                    of this clan also possess an innate ability whcih allows them to expel chakra from any of the tenketsu(nodes from which chakra can be released) in their body. The Hyuga clan are <br>
                    descendants from the Otsutsuki clan, specifically from Hamura Otsutsuki's lineage. As a result, they are also distant cousins of the Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki, and Kaguya clans. The <br>
                    Byakugan(Meaning: White Eye) is a kekkei genkai that originated from the Otsutsuki clan. After the Otsutsuki settled on Earth, the Byakugan became more commonly associated with the <br>
                    Hyuga Clan, descendants of the Otsutsuki. It is regarded as one of the "Great Three Dojutsu", the others being the Sharingan and the Rinnegan. Unlike dojutsu like the Sharingan, which <br>
                    don't manifest unless certain conditions are met, the Byakugan is present from the time of birth. Individuals with the Byakugan have a near-360 field of vision around themselves. The <br>
                    only small blindspot is at the back of the nexk above the first thoracic vertebra.</p>

                <p>The Chinoike Clan was a clan active during the Warring States Period. Its members possess the Ketryugan, a kekkei genkai that grants them the ability to manipulate liquids with high iron <br>
                content. In the Warring States Period, the Chinoike clan were on of the many mercenary ninja clans active in the Land of Lightning. The individuals that possessed the Ketsuryugan allowed <br>
                    them to perform powerful genjutsu, or comparable strength to the Uchiha clan's Sharingan. They can also use the Ketsuryugan to manipulate liquids of high iron content, such as blood or <br>
                    the water that flows in the Valley of Hell. Before they can manipulate such liquids, they need to imbue it with their chakra first.</p>
